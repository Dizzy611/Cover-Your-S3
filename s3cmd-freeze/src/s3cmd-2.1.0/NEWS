s3cmd 1.1.0   -   (never released)
===========

* CloudFront invalidation via [sync --cf-invalidate] and [cfinvalinfo].
* Increased socket_timeout from 10 secs to 5 mins.
* Added "Static WebSite" support [ws-create / ws-delete / ws-info]
  (contributed by Jens Braeuer)
* Force MIME type with --mime-type=abc/xyz, also --guess-mime-type
  is now on by default, -M is no longer shorthand for --guess-mime-type
* Allow parameters in MIME types, for example:
  --mime-type="text/plain; charset=utf-8"
* MIME type can be guessed by python-magic which is a lot better than
  relying on the extension. Contributed by Karsten Sperling.
* Support for environment variables as config values. For instance
  in ~/.s3cmd put "access_key=$S3_ACCESS_KEY". Contributed by Ori Bar.
* Support for --configure checking access to a specific bucket instead
  of listing all buckets.
  Listing buckets requires the S3 ListAllMyBuckets permission which
  is typically not available to delegated IAM accounts. With this change,
  s3cmd --configure accepts an (optional) bucket uri as a parameter
  and if it's provided, the access check will just verify access to this
  bucket individually. Contributed by Mike Repass.
* Allow STDOUT as a destination even for downloading multiple files.
  They will be output one after another without any delimiters!
  Contributed by Rob Wills.
